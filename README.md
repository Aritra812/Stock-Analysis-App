- Generate **candlestick charts** using `mplfinance`  
- **Predict future stock prices** using a basic Linear Regression model

## Disclaimer
This is for **educational purposes only**.  
The prediction model is very simple and should **not** be used for actual trading decisions.  
This is just a **normal AI project**, and I am currently working on a **similar but more efficient AI** that will provide better accuracy and features.
